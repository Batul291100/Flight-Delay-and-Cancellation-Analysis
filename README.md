Flight Delay and Cancellation Analysis 

Project Overview:
Flight Delay and Cancellation Analysis is a comprehensive analysis and prediction project aimed at understanding and addressing the challenges of delays in the aviation industry. Through detailed exploration of extensive datasets, this project identifies key factors contributing to flight delays. Utilizing advanced data visualization tools, it offers valuable insights into the dynamics of departure and arrival delays, their causes, and their impacts on airline profitability and customer satisfaction.

Features:
Data Merging: Integration of multiple datasets into a singular, cohesive dataset for analysis.
Data Analysis (EDA): Utilization of Tableau and matplotlib for in-depth visualization and analysis.

Dataset:
The project analyzes an extensive dataset with over 1 million rows, covering various aspects of flight operations, including departure delays, arrival delays, and their underlying causes. 

The dataset can be accessed through the following link: [Flight Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays/data)

Analysis Highlights:
Departure Delays: Identified as a primary cause of subsequent arrival delays, with security, airline system delays, and other factors playing significant roles.

Conclusion
This project underscores the critical impact of departure and arrival delays on the aviation industry. By addressing these delays, airlines can significantly enhance profitability and customer satisfaction.
